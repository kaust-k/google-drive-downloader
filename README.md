A tool to recursively download files from particular Google Drive folder


- Coded to download files from  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8e3dtbFwQWUZ1I5dklCMmE5M2M

- It attempts to download most recent file first (today's) and then goes back in time (day by day) and stops when any file is found locally.

- There are few hacks based on file naming conventions in that folder
